## About The Project

The `armada-security` package provides tools to authenticate and authorize request in a FastAPI app.
The `TokenSecurity` module can be used with FastAPI's dependency injection to make adding security
to endpoints very simple.

The `armada-security` package was built specifically for use with Auth0, but any OIDC complient
platform should work with it as well.

Though `armada-security` provides everything you need to apply security, you will still need to
manage users and permissions through the OIDC platform itself.


### Supported algorithms

The `armada-security` package has been tested with the following algorithms for authentication:

* HS256 for the standard TokenManager
* RS256 for the AsymmetricManager

The `armada-security` package should function with any of the algorithms supported by the
[python-jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) jwt package. However, no verification
of functionality has been done outside of HS256 and RS256 yet.


## Installation

The `armada-security` package can be installed like any other python package. For now, though, it
is only hosted on OmniVector's internal package index at pypicloud.omnivector.solutions.


### Poetry

To install via poetry, you need to add the following section to `pyproject.toml`

```
[[tool.poetry.source]]
name = "pypicloud"
url = "https://pypicloud.omnivector.solutions/simple"
```

Then run:
```bash
$ poetry add armada-security
```


### Pip

To install directly with `pip`, you can use the `--index-url` command line argument:

```bash
$ pip install --index-url=https://pypicloud.omnivector.solutions/simple armada-security
```


## Example Usage

```python
from armasec import TokenManager, TokenSecurity, TokenPayload
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel


app = FastAPI()

manager = TokenManager(
    secret="my-closely-guarded-client-secret",
    algorithm="RS256",
    client_id="my-client-id",
    domain="mydomain.com",
    audience="https://my-service-api.mydomain.com",
)
read_stuff_security = TokenSecurity(manager, scopes=["read:stuff"])

@app.get("/stuff")
async def get_items(token_payload: TokenPayload = Depends(read_stuff_security)):
    return dict(
        message="Successfully authenticated!",
        token_payload=token_payload,
    )
```
